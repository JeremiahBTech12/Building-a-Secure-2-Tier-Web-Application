# Building-a-Secure-2-Tier-Web-Application
In this lab I build a classic "IaaS" Architecture. I will create a Virtual Network with two subnets: a "Public" subnet for a Web Server and a "Private" subnet for a Database Server. I'll also configure Network Security Groups (NSGs) to ensure the Database Server is protected from the internet and can only be accessed by the Web Server. I will be using Linux CLI to connect to the public server and jump to the private server validating talk between the two using a simple ping command.
